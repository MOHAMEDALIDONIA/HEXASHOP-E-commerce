## Project Overview
Hexashop is an e-commerce platform built with Laravel, designed to handle various aspects of an online store, including product management, user authentication, payments, and more. This project provides an intuitive interface for both administrators and users, with distinct authentication for each.

## Purchasing Process Description for the E-commerce Site:
The purchasing process on the site involves selecting products based on the user's preferences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Product Selection: Users browse through products and choose specific options like color and quantity.
Adding to Cart: Once the user has selected the desired options, they can add the items to their shopping cart for review.
Entering Personal Details: When ready to complete the purchase, the user is prompted to enter their details including their name, email address, shipping location, and the desired time of order receipt.
Payment Choice: The user then selects the payment method:
Cash on Delivery (COD): Pay when the order is delivered.
Online Payment: Pay instantly through a secure payment gateway integrated with the website.
Order Submission: After selecting the payment method, the order details are saved in the system.
Admin Communication: The admin has access to the order details and will review the user's information, contact them if necessary, and ensure smooth order processing for the best service.
